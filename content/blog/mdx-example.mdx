# MDX Example

This is a sample blog post written in MDX, which allows you to use React components directly in your content.

## Custom Components

You can create custom components and use them in your MDX files. Here's an example of how you could use a custom button component:

<Button>Click me!</Button>

## Interactive Elements

MDX allows you to create interactive elements. Here's a simple counter component:

<Counter initialCount={0} />

## Styling with Tailwind

You can use Tailwind classes directly in your MDX:

<div className="bg-brand/10 p-6 rounded-xl border border-brand/20">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Custom Styled Box</h3>
  <p className="text-text dark:text-text-dark">
    This is a custom styled box using Tailwind classes.
  </p>
</div>

## Code Blocks

MDX supports all the same markdown features as regular markdown files:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("MDX"));
```

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful extension of markdown that allows you to use React components directly in your content. This makes it perfect for creating interactive documentation, blog posts, and more!
