Initially, Evan Williams [founded Medium with the vision of creating a long-form version of Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/14/twitter-co-founder-evan-williams-lays-out-his-vision-for-medium/), providing a space for writers to share content beyond the limitations of 140 characters. While Medium has been a popular platform for many, exploring other options can offer unique features and benefits that may better align with your goals.

If you're a content creator, staying up-to-date with the best online blogging platforms is crucial to establishing your online presence, building your readership, and expanding your audience.

Here are some of the top Medium alternatives for 2024, each offering distinct features, whether free or paid to help you share your content, and reach and engage with your audience.

### 1\. Differ

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*pTSRP5HFjRAsuJrm)

[Differ.blog](https://differ.blog/) is a unique blogging platform that's **completely free to use**. It aims to create a more straightforward and engaging user experience for both writers and readers, and stands out for its transparency and control offered over content visibility, avoiding algorithmic curation along the way.

This approach (powerful filters placed in the user's hand, rather than the black box of an algorithm) allows readers to find the stories they want to read without being inundated with suggested content based on past behavior.

Alongside the standard rich-text editor, **Differ fully supports markdown syntax**. You can use markdown shortcuts like # for headings, > for blockquotes, and triple backticks (followed by a language) for code blocks. This is perfect for markdown enthusiasts, allowing you to effortlessly copy and paste your markdown content directly into Differ.

What's more, Differ's curation team will pick a number of articles weekly (from any topic; it just has to be good enough) to showcase on the homepage, increasing your chances of reaching more readers. Besides the showcase, the platform also offers a Trending section that ranks the top-performing articles by views, meaning if your article is getting more views, it can remain featured on the homepage for way longer than a week.

Users also get the **ability to create publications** that other users can follow and engage with. Like Medium, publications are essentially a hub for stories that are related by topic.

Differ is open to all topics ranging from pop culture to gaming, from politics to entertainment, tech to marketing, programming, storytelling, and more. Because of its intriguing approach, eschewing algorithmic content entirely, writers must add proper tags to their articles and adjust titles and metadata for SEO to increase reach, and readers need to filter their search based on appropriate tags. You'll have full control over your story, for better or worse.

Differ also regularly offers paid writing opportunities through [writing contests](https://differ.blog/p/differ-writing-challenge-announcement-5bde3d) that hand out cash prizes weekly.

**ðŸ‘‰ _For information on the writing challenge, check out their_ **[**_official publication_**](https://differ.blog/blog)**_._**

**Cost:** Completely free to use. You can even create and customize your own publications for free.

**Pros:**

- **Transparent approach that enables freedom of expression**: Differ does not use algorithms to suggest content, offering a more transparent and user-driven experience. Writers can post their content without worrying about algorithmic biases that might limit their audience.
- **User engagement**: By focusing on user preferences rather than algorithms, Differ fosters a community where content visibility is more democratic.
- **Human curation team to find the best of the best:** Differ showcases exceptional stories regularly on the homepage, hand-picked by its experienced, diverse, and multicultural team.
- **Ability to create publications:** Much like Medium, Differ offers a publication feature to house articles related to similar topics.
- **A powerful rich-text editor that is markdown aware:** Beneficial for anyone more familiar with markdown, or preferring to import their articles stored in markdown format.

**Cons:**

- **It's a fairly new platform**: As Differ is a new platform it might take time initially to increase impressions. To help this along, you can share posts on various social media channels where you have more followers, or on platforms like Reddit.
- **Early in development**: While Differ offers the basics needed for blogging, right now it might lack some advanced features like advanced analytics, or an archive that can be sorted and filtered datewise. However, it is constantly in development, with new features added each week.

Differ is truly unique compared to anything on this list and could be one of the breakout platforms in the coming months. Check it out yourself, by [signing up for free](https://differ.blog/).
